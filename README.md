# Building a Full-Text Search App Using Docker and Elasticsearch

*How does Wikipedia sort though 5+ million articles to find the most relevant one for your research?*

*How does Facebook find the friend who you're looking for (and whose name you've misspelled), across a userbase of 2+ billion people?*

*How does Google search the entire internet for webpages relevant to your vague, typo-filled search query?*

In this tutorial, we'll walk through setting up our own full-text search application (of an admittedly lesser complexity than the systems in the questions above).  Our example app will provide a UI and API to search the complete texts of 100 literary classics such as *Peter Pan*, *Frankenstein*, and *Treasure Island*.

You can preview a completed version of the tutorial app here - https://search.patricktriest.com
